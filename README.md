I am a second-year ECE Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am part of the RoboTouch Lab led by Prof. [Wenzhen Yuan](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/yuanwz) at the CS department. My research interests lie in the fields of tactile sensing and robotic manipulation.
